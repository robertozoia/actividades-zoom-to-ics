# actividades-zoom-to-ics

During the COVID-19 pandemic, our kids are having school classes remotely via Zoom.  Every week, the school sends a PDF file with the week's Zoom sessions, their IDs and passwords. If you want to schedule the sessions in your calendar, and include an url to open the session automatically, then you need to do it by hand.

This script extracts the relevant data from the table, and generates several calendar (.ics) files that you can use to add the sessions to you calendar application.

The PDF format is particular to the school and even to the grade (generated from a Word document, probably).  So don't expect this to be of use to you without modifying the code.
